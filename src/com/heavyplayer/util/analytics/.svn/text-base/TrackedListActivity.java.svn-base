/**
 * Extend this class instead of ListActivity to enable Google Analytics Tracking
 * for a ListActivity.  Note that for accurate application-level tracking,
 * <emph>all</emph> Activities in an application must either extend one of the
 * TrackedActivity classes (i.e. TrackedActivity, TrackedListActivity) or
 * implement the calls found in this class.  This is necessary as the
 * EasyTracking library maintains a count of active Activities in order to
 * determine when a session starts and ends and relies on the fact that a new
 * Activity's onStart method is called before the old Activity's onStop method
 * is called.
 *
 * The one exception to this flow is when an Activity is being restarted because
 * of a configuration change (i.e. orientation change) where the
 * onRetainNonConfigurationInstance method is called after the Activity's onStop
 * method is called and before the new Activity's onStart is called.
 * 
 * See the file ReadMe.txt for details on setting up tracking using the
 * EasyTracker library.
